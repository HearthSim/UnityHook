# UnityHook

UnityHook is a simple platform for hooking managed function calls, targeting
specifically assemblies compiled for [Unity3d](http://unity3d.com/) games.

Installed hooks allow overriding hooked functions' return values, essentially
granting complete control over managed code execution in a targeted game.

# Minimal dependancies

This branch tries to keep the amount of compile-time dependancies as small as possible. Minimal compile-time dependancies 
make it easier to distribute the **HooksRegistry** binary (and independant of **Hooker**). All compiled binaries are more robust 
and have a higher chance of working when new game versions are released. This also has a big downside; every method call 
has to be done in a dynamic way and complex operations are tedious because of the dynamic overhead.

>Because of the tedious work it also forces us to come up with more 'outside of the box' solutions. This alone makes the projects
interesting and challenging to work on!

## Build

1. Clone the repo;
2. Open UnityHook solution file with Visual Studio;
3. Build project **Hooker**;
4. Build project **HookRegistry**;
5. All binary files can be found inside the `bin` folder of each project.

## Hooker

**Hooker** is the project that actually injects code into original game assemblies/libraries (= .dll files).
It can be used to 'hook' and 'restore' assemblies. Run `hooker.exe help` for information about the options to pass.
To hook game assemblies you need to tell it the location of the game folder and the path to a compiled **HookRegistry**.
The **Hooker** currently has support for following games

- Hearthstone

## HookRegistry

**HookRegistry** is the project that contains code to be executed when a hooked method/function has been called
while the game is running. The project compiles to 1 binary file that must be passed to **Hooker**.
Currently implemented hooks are following

- Hearthstone
    - Disable SSL connection between client/server;
    - Duplicate packets transferred between client/server to other TCP streams. These streams try to attach to the
    [HearthStone packet dumper tool](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Packet-Dumps/tree/master/tools). 
- General
    - Hooking into the Unity logger.

## Hooks file
The file which contains all methods to be hooked. See `{REPOPATH}\Hooker\example_hooks` for more information
about it's syntax. The example_hooks file is needed for the example at the next section.

**NOTE:** The hooker will always hook all methods entered in the Hooks file, if found. 
Hooking a method which is not expected by **HooksRegistry** has NO side effect on the game!   

## Usage Example
> The example expects the example_hooks file to be used as of the latest commit, including the **HookRegistry** compiled binary.

Effects of the example
- The game creates a non secure connection to the server (NOT over TLS);
- All transferred network packets are being duplicated to other TCP streams.

What you need

- The (compiled) binaries **PATH** from **Hooker**. Refered to as {HOOKERPATH};
- The (compiled) binary **FILE** from **HookRegistry**. Referred to as {REGISTRY};
- The **PATH** to the game folder. Referred to as {GAMEDIR};
- A hooks **FILE**, as mentioned above. Referred to as {HOOKS}.
    
Steps

1. Call Hooker.exe;
```
{HOOKERPATH}\Hooker.exe hook -d "{GAMEDIR}" -h "{HOOKS}" -l "{REGISTRY}"
```
2. Verify that that Hooker did not encounter a problem;
    - Requested methods are hooked;
    - Original assemblies are duplicated next to the original as {name}.original.dll;
    - Patched assemblies are written to the game directory as {name}.out.dll;
    - Patched assemblies replace the original assemblies as {name}.dll;
    - **HookRegistry** assembly is copied next to the game assemblies;
3. Run the Game - Watch the game log for lines starting with [HOOKER].

> To restore, run the command ```{HOOKERPATH}\Hooker.exe restore -d "{GAMEDIR}"```
